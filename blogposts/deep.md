<!-- Back in 2012-2013, when i was in college, i spent six whole months doing deep-dive on making a multiplayer pacman, but also on multiplayer tech itself. Going from client-side prediction, server ticks, websockets, efficient message packing, game lobbies and region locking players to closest server, even down to tcp/udp packets and network congestions etc. It was intense. There was no explicit goal or deadlines just pure obsession. I eventually gave up and life became busier.

But those specific learnings helped a lot when I was writing Playroom in 2023, about a decade later. Playroom is an easy-to-use SDK for adding multiplayer to your games and comes with multiplayer lobby, matchmaking, unreliable (webrtc) and reliable (websockets) mode, etc.

Playroom now serves 10M+ MAUs across many games effortlessly.

This is just one firm instance of how doing interesting hard things for no immediate monetary rewards has benefitted me later. -->

Back in 2012-2013, during my college days, I devoted six intense months to a deep dive into multiplayer Pac-Man and the intricacies of game netcode. My exploration covered everything from client-side prediction, server ticks, and WebSockets, to efficient message packing, game lobbies, region locking, and even the nuances of TCP/UDP packets and network congestion. It was an intense period, driven purely by obsession rather than explicit goals or deadlines. Eventually, I set it aside as life grew busier.

A decade later, around 2023, those specific learnings became invaluable while I was building Playroom. Playroom is an easy-to-use SDK for adding multiplayer functionality to games, offering features like multiplayer lobbies, matchmaking, unreliable (WebRTC) and reliable (WebSockets) modes, player and room states, RPCs, etc.

Today, [Playroom](https://docs.joinplayroom.com) effortlessly serves over 10 million monthly active users across numerous games.

This stands as a clear instance of how pursuing interesting, challenging work, particularly in its depths and without the immediate prospect of monetary reward, has greatly benefited me later in life.
