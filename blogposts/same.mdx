description: Everything is optimized, standardized, uniform, predictable, same. Where goes our creative expression?
issue: 10

<!-- In our hyper-connected world, we're losing our appreciation for the unique and diverse. This could be due to everything becoming commoditized, or perhaps because of decision-makers reluctant to take risks. I'm still exploring the reasons, but it's clear this trend is a real, troubling issue. I'm gathering examples of this phenomenon. Please share any you have; I'll add them to my growing list and credit your contribution. -->

I am collecting examples of a weird phenomenon where we are losing our taste for the unique and diverse. All our music, buildings, cities, UI, etc looks the same.

The logical answer is that as things are optimized, they converge to a local maxima. This combined with the hyper-connected world we live in, results in nobody escaping the local maxima.

Maybe it's [the tyranny of the marginal user](https://nothinghuman.substack.com/p/the-tyranny-of-the-marginal-user). Is it the weak CEOs and their "Nobody Gets Fired For Buying IBM" mindset. I am not too sure yet. 

This is a real disaster that is really bumming me out!

Below is a list of examples I have collected so far. I'll keep adding to this list as encounter more examples.

If you have any examples, feel free to share below. I'll add them to the list and credit you.

<!-- 
I want to highlight something that's been bugging me. As everything become a commodity; a standardized product that can be bought and sold, there's often a pressure to make them more uniform and predictable. Businesses aim to create products that cater to the widest possible audience to maximize sales. Better be acceptable for 1000 people than beautiful for 10. 

This has been talked about 
Isn't this the biggest restriction on creativity? -->

<!-- In this era where everything is connected, knowledge transfers easily across globe and is as easy as a few taps on our screens, have we unknowingly let go of our own flavor? Sure, tech has revolutionized how we do things, but is it secretly homogenizing our creative mojo? -->

<!-- I have been collecting examples of this phenomenon across various domains. I'll share my list here. -->

### Cars: The Fading Spectrum of Expression

The automotive industry offers a vivid portrayal of the shift toward uniformity. Over the years, the colors of cars on the road have transitioned from a vibrant spectrum to a monotonous sea of gray, white, and black. While these colors may signify elegance and modernity, they also reflect a diminishing range of individual expression on the road. Are we sacrificing personal style and identity for a sense of conformity?

### Architecture

<!-- The architectural landscape of our cities has transformed dramatically over the decades. A glimpse at snapshots from the 1960s juxtaposed with present-day urban scenery showcases a remarkable shift.  -->
Modern buildings may be sleek and functional, but a sense of nostalgia for the ornate and diverse structures of the past lingers. As architecture embraces minimalist designs and uniform aesthetics, are we losing the distinctive identities that once defined cities and neighborhoods?

### UI Minimalism: Streamlined Yet Uniform

User interfaces have evolved significantly, becoming streamlined and intuitive. However, this shift towards UI minimalism has also led to a certain uniformity in design. Android and iOS look just the same,.

### Content: From Diversity to Convergence

The convergence of diverse content into a "content sludge" is strikingly visible. The vast array of entertainment options at our fingertips seems to paradoxically contribute to a more uniform viewing experience. As genres blend and narrative structures converge, the boundary-pushing, genre-defying content that once flourished could be dwindling in favor of easily digestible and predictable plots.

### Music: Homogenization of Sound

The realm of music provides another perspective on this phenomenon. While the past witnessed a proliferation of diverse musical genres, today's mainstream music landscape often leans toward generic pop or "chill" vibes, with a homogenization of sound that's hard to ignore. Key changes, a staple of musical evolution, have become less common in popular songs, potentially contributing to a sense of monotony.

<!-- ### Typography and Color: Safe and Familiar Choices

The world of typography and color reveals a similar trend. From the fonts we encounter daily to the colors that surround us, a preference for safe and familiar choices has emerged. Safe fonts dominate our screens, and even the vibrant spectrum of colors that once defined our surroundings has faded into a more muted palette. The surge in gray and beige tones in everything from homes to cars and carpets reflects a broader inclination toward the unobtrusive. -->

### Loss of Dreaming for the Future

A striking revelation is the decline in our collective dreams for the future. The rapid pace of technological advancements may have contributed to a sense of complacency, stifling the imaginative aspirations that once fueled innovation. As we become more accustomed to the convenience of the present, the allure of the unknown future seems to be waning.

### The Decision-Making Process: Safety, Invisibility, and Consumer Taste

So, how do these changes come about? The decision-making process often centers on safety and invisibility. CEOs and decision-makers may opt for designs, colors, and content that are less likely to offend or alienate a broad audience. Moreover, builders and creators might lean towards simpler designs due to a perception that consumers have less discerning taste and are willing to buy anything. While this approach ensures a wider appeal and minimizes risk, it also flattens the uniqueness and diversity that once defined various aspects of our lives.

In conclusion, our hyper-connected world has undoubtedly brought forth immense convenience and accessibility, but it may have inadvertently led to a subtle erosion of originality. The convergence of styles, sounds, and visuals, driven by a preference for the safe and familiar, raises questions about the richness of our creative expression. Perhaps, as we adapt to this new era, a resurgence of individuality and uniqueness will emerge, reminding us of the value of diversity in all aspects of our lives. -->
