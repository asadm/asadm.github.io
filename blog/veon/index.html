I shall quote Paul Graham’s here:</p><blockquote><p>I should mention one sort of initial tactic that usually doesn’t work: the Big Launch. I occasionally meet founders who seem to believe startups are projectiles rather than powered aircraft, and that they’ll make it big if and only if they’re launched with sufficient initial velocity. They want to launch simultaneously in 8 different publications, with embargoes. And on a tuesday, of course, since they read somewhere that’s the optimum day to launch something.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It’s easy to see how little launches matter. Think of some successful startups. How many of their launches do you remember? All you need from a launch is some initial core of users. How well you’re doing a few months later will depend more on how happy you made those users than how many there were of them.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>— From: <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html">Do Things That Don’t Scale</a></p></blockquote><p>Now, I am no “social network” expert but instead of doing a huge launch, and spending huge cash on few seconds of user attention. They could have:</p><ul><li><strong>Started with a small, well-connected user base:</strong> Similar to how Facebook first launched for one college only. Every social networks evolved from a small user base.</li><li><strong>Started with an invite-only:</strong> This helps in forming well-connected graph. So when you join, your friends are already there (since they invited you in the first place). This also creates exclusivity.</li><li><strong>Started with one feature first:</strong> VEON’s trying to do everything right now. They could have focused on doing one thing really well instead.</li></ul><p>So yeah. These are my raw views on the whole VEON situation as a founder myself.
