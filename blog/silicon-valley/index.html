The two weeks of the program were pretty busy but I did manage to explore some of the things there during and after the program.</p><p>Before coming, I had following assumptions about the valley:<br/>
<!-- -->-<!-- --> People here are very tech-savvy.<br/>
<!-- -->-<!-- --> This area has higher percentage of quality programmers.<br/>
<!-- -->-<!-- --> The startup scene is crazy here.<br/>
<!-- -->-<!-- --> The place itself inspires creativity.</p><p>Following are some notes about random things I noticed:</p><p><strong>PALO ALTO</strong></p><p><img src="/assets/blog/old_posts/0__JeTkVwwwtIvZWUBR.jpg"/></p><p>So Palo Alto is a beautiful and modern suburb near San Francisco. It is arguably the core of the valley. People are really well mannered here but living here is pretty expensive. This place is also home to many tech companies. Cafes here are filled with investors, founders, and engineers from tech companies of the area. The weather is great here. As my friend says, most optimal for creativity.</p><p>The first morning I woke up, I was surprised to see so many runners and cyclists up and on streets at 7–8 AM. Even the old people were out in tracksuits walking their dogs.</p><p><strong>CALTRAIN</strong></p><p><img src="/assets/blog/old_posts/0__mHTGFpdqju90NfkN.jpg"/></p><p>Caltrain is the main train system which connects all these suburbs (Palo Alto, Mountain View, etc) to <em>The City</em> (San Francisco). The train is heavily used by everyone here.</p><p>The average fare is ~$6 one-way. There are ticket vending machines at the stations. Money/Card goes in, tickets and change come out. The trains are pretty clean just like the rest of the city.</p><p><strong>BLACKBOX PROGRAM</strong></p><p><img src="/assets/blog/old_posts/0__OBjTkqwa9Danxdy8.jpg"/></p><p>So our main purpose of visit was the <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fblackbox.vc&amp;t=MzY2NjlmOTM5OGI4YmYzZDdiMjk1ZGE3N2U4MTk2NWVmYjc0MTcyNSxwTFY4WmN6bA%3D%3D">Blackbox</a> program.
