These are my observations about the place in both technical and general sense as a techie from a developing country.</p><p><img src="/assets/blog/old_posts/0__FV2UM4tO6DxrMFO4.jpg"/></p><p><em>Note: I aim to be brief here. I wrote this while waiting at the airport, so might not be so well written.</em></p><p>We had been selected in a pre-accelerator program called <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fblackbox.vc%2Fblackbox-connect-fall-2014%2F&amp;t=MDg4NTU0Y2ViYjk4MjlmYWU5OGU2Njk4YWYxNjk5NDgwNGZhMDUxYyxwTFY4WmN6bA%3D%3D">Blackbox Connect</a>. The two weeks of the program were pretty busy but I did manage to explore some of the things there during and after the program.</p><p>Before coming, I had following assumptions about the valley:<br/>
<!-- -->-<!-- --> People here are very tech-savvy.<br/>
<!-- -->-<!-- --> This area has higher percentage of quality programmers.<br/>
<!-- -->-<!-- --> The startup scene is crazy here.<br/>
<!-- -->-<!-- --> The place itself inspires creativity.</p><p>Following are some notes about random things I noticed:</p><p><strong>PALO ALTO</strong></p><p><img src="/assets/blog/old_posts/0__JeTkVwwwtIvZWUBR.jpg"/></p><p>So Palo Alto is a beautiful and modern suburb near San Francisco. It is arguably the core of the valley. People are really well mannered here but living here is pretty expensive. This place is also home to many tech companies. Cafes here are filled with investors, founders, and engineers from tech companies of the area. The weather is great here. As my friend says, most optimal for creativity.</p><p>The first morning I woke up, I was surprised to see so many runners and cyclists up and on streets at 7–8 AM. Even the old people were out in tracksuits walking their dogs.</p><p><strong>CALTRAIN</strong></p><p><img src="/assets/blog/old_posts/0__mHTGFpdqju90NfkN.jpg"/></p><p>Caltrain is the main train system which connects all these suburbs (Palo Alto, Mountain View, etc) to <em>The City</em> (San Francisco). The train is heavily used by everyone here.</p><p>The average fare is ~$6 one-way. There are ticket vending machines at the stations. Money/Card goes in, tickets and change come out. The trains are pretty clean just like the rest of the city.</p><p><strong>BLACKBOX PROGRAM</strong></p><p><img src="/assets/blog/old_posts/0__OBjTkqwa9Danxdy8.jpg"/></p><p>So our main purpose of visit was the <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fblackbox.vc&amp;t=MzY2NjlmOTM5OGI4YmYzZDdiMjk1ZGE3N2U4MTk2NWVmYjc0MTcyNSxwTFY4WmN6bA%3D%3D">Blackbox</a> program. We were staying at Cowper Inn which was a nice historic building turned hotel and rented out by Blackbox for the program duration. The hotel owner is a nice fellow who had retired some years ago and is an avid Apple fan (iPhone6, iTV, Airport Wifi).</p><p>The program itself was really helpful for entrepreneurs new here. The focus was on pitching, legal, investors, management and generally on how to be successful.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong><br/>
<!-- -->-<!-- --> Silicon Valley 101<br/>
<!-- -->-<!-- --> Met great established founders, famous people, heard their stories/exits.<br/>
<!-- -->-<!-- --> Diversity, there were startups from every side of the globe in the batch.<br/>
<!-- -->-<!-- --> Food was good, even for people with dietary restrictions.</p><p><strong>Cons</strong><br/>
<!-- -->-<!-- --> Didn’t excite the nerd inside me much, not much technical stuff.<br/>
